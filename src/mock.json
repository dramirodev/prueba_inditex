From sleeping 5-to-1 in pursuit of his Aaliyah dream to serendipitously encountering Keri Hilson earlier in her career, Scantz releases crazy tales of risking it all in a state of emergency. Barely missing a credit on Usher's smash \"Yeah\" while paying life-changing dues that prepared him to later mentor so many in this game. This rare ride rivals movies in the uncensored chronicle of R&B history you simply need to experience. Donnie Scantz is now on The R&B Money Podcast!\n\n \n\nExtended Episodes on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/RnBMoneyPodcast\n\nFollow The Podcast:\n\nTank: @therealtank  \n\nJ Valentine: @JValentine\n\nPodcast: @RnbMoneyPodcast\n\n \nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

Tracing his journey from scrappy club promoter in DC to executive roles at Motown and beyond, Burns reflects on pivotal lessons in shepherding talent like Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, and Monica early on.\n\nWith humor and candor, he contemplates the ever-changing nature of music culture and hip hop’s loss of “heart” today, while considering R&B’s resurgence. Burns also shares hard-won wisdom on aligning with one’s authentic self and purpose in order to uplift community beyond fame and fortune.\n\n \n\nExtended Episodes on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/RnBMoneyPodcast\n\nFollow The Podcast:\n\nTank: @therealtank  \n\nJ Valentine: @JValentine\n\nPodcast: @RnbMoneyPodcast\n\n \nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

      "description": "This week on The R&B Money Podcast, Tank and J Valentine welcome the phenomenal Jozzy. Growing up in Memphis, Jozzy got her start songwriting by working with local rappers and producers. She then connected with producer Wiz, who brought her to Miami to write hooks and songs with artists like Lil Wayne, Rocko, and Young Joc visiting the studio.\n\nWhile in Miami, Jozzy also began working with producer Polow da Don, landing placements like Fergie's “Milf Money.” She later collaborated with Chris Brown, co-writing the song “Discover” on his album Royalty. Jozzy also spent formative time living and writing at Missy Elliott’s house in New Jersey during this period.\n\nConstantly surrounding herself with established industry veterans, Jozzy soaked up knowledge from the likes of Timbaland and Missy while strategically putting herself in rooms to grow as a songwriter. From Memphis to Miami to LA, it’s clear Jozzy put in the work early on to become the phenomenal songwriter she is today - even co-writing one of the biggest hit songs in recent years. Enjoy Jozzy on The R&B Money Podcast!\n\n \n\nExtended Episodes on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/RnBMoneyPodcast\n\nFollow The Podcast:\n\nTank: @therealtank  \n\nJ Valentine: @JValentine\n\nPodcast: @RnbMoneyPodcast\n\n \nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
